# frontend for ScsMS
A web project using angular-brunch-seed

## How to use angular-brunch-seed

* `git clone https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed.git` to clone 
  the **angular-brunch-seed** repository
* `cd angular-brunch-seed`
* `./scripts/init.sh` to install node packages

Or if you have **Brunch** installed run:

`brunch new https://github.com/scotch/angular-brunch-seed myapp`

You must also install packages using bower. Either

```
bower install
```
or
```
./node_modules/.bin/bower install
```

*NOTE:* Depending upon your connection and processor speed the build can take
a substantial amount of time (3 - 15 minutes). The bower step is particularly
slow, because it downloads the complete git history. If you think that there
might be a problems, check you network traffic. If the build is still
downloading then it's still working.
